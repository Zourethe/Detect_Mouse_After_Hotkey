# Detect Mouse After Hotkey

This is a simple code that allows you to detect when your mouse is pressed and execute an action if the hotkey (Ctrl + Shift + 12) was already pressed once. If you press the hotkey again it will de-activate, and the action will no more execute when you press the mouse.

The code is totally made using pynput module.
